# Trino Software Foundation Contributor License Agreements

The Trino Software Foundation requires that all contributors of ideas,
code, or documentation to Trino complete, sign, and submit via [email](mailto:cla@trino.io) an
[Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/trinodb/cla/raw/master/Trino%20Foundation%20Individual%20CLA.pdf).

Our agreement reproduces without alteration the Apache Software Foundation
Individual and Corporate Contributor License agreements for changing appropriate
references.

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which
intellectual property has been contributed to the Trino Software Foundation
 and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute
 regarding the software at some future time. A signed CLA is required to be
 on file before contributions can be accepted into Trino.

A corporation that has assigned employees to work on Trino should sign a 
[Corporate CLA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trinodb/cla/master/Trino%20Foundation%20Corporate%20CLA.txt). 
Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every 
developer to sign their own Individual CLA, which covers both contributions 
which are owned and those that are not owned by the corporation signing the 
Corporate CLA.

The Corporate CLA legally binds the corporation, so it must be signed by a
person with authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation.

The Individual CLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended
to use one's personal email address in the contact details, rather than an
@work address. Your Full name will be public. The email address and other contact details are
not published.
